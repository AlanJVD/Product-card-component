## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned about how the CSS display properties work and how they interact with other elements. Another thing I learned is about media queries for mobile design. It is incredible how we can create responsive designs by using this CSS property.

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  height: 100vh;
  flex-direction: row;
}

.price-container {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
}
```

### Continued development

I will be studying and practicing CSS media queries in order to improve my mobile design skills. Also, I will be reading the documentation of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

### Useful resources

- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped me to understand more about CSS display properties and media queries. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning.
